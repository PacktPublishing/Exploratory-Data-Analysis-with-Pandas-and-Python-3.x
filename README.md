## About the Video Course
How do you take your data analysis skills beyond Excel to the next level? By learning just enough Python to get stuff done. This hands-on course shows non-programmers how to process information that’s initially too messy or difficult to access. Through various step-by-step exercises, you’ll learn how to acquire, clean, analyze, and present data efficiently. 

This course will take you from Python basics to explore many different types of data. Throughout the course, you will be working with real-world datasets to retrieve insights from data. You'll be exposed to different kinds of data structure and data-related problems. You'll learn how to prepare data for analysis, perform simple statistical analyses, create meaningful data visualizations, predict future trends from data, and more!
